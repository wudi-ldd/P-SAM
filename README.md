## P-SAM

P-SAM is a framework designed for achieving more accurate semantic segmentation leveraging imprecise semantic segmentation mask prompts. Our approach is tailored to refine the segmentation process, enhancing the accuracy of object delineation in complex images.

### Dataset Annotation
Our dataset has been annotated using a semi-automatic labeling tool developed specifically for this project. This tool enables efficient and precise annotation, significantly reducing the manual effort required while ensuring high-quality segmentation masks.
