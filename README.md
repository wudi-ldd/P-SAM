# P-SAM
## P-SAM

P-SAM is a framework for more accurate semantic segmentation by leveraging imprecise semantic segmentation mask cues. Our approach is tailored to refine the segmentation process, enhancing the accuracy of object delineation in complex images.

### Dataset Annotation
Our dataset has been annotated using a semi-automatic labeling tool developed specifically for this project. This tool enables efficient and precise annotation, significantly reducing the manual effort required while ensuring high-quality segmentation masks. [SAM-Annotation](https://github.com/wudi-ldd/SAM-Annotation).

### Official Pretrained Weights
The official pre-trained weights for P-SAM can be accessed through the following link: [SAM Official Website](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).

### Updates
Please stay tuned for updates on our dataset and the pre-trained weights for this method. We are committed to continually improving and updating our resources to support the research and application of precise semantic segmentation.
